# Conway-Game-of-Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Game of Life's Rules:-

A live cell with fewer than two live neighbouring cells dies (underpopulation)
A live cell with more than three live neighbouring cells dies (overpopulation)
A live cell with two or three live neighbouring survives
A dead cell with three neighbourig cells becomes a live cell (reproduction)

##  Variations of Traditional CA:

 - Implement functionality to make Mouse Left Click draw on the grid (Activate a cell)
 - Change the cells so that it becomes non-rectangular when it is activated or not
 - Make the cell color a random color each time it is activated (State = 1)

## Requirements :-

- Pygame : pip install pygame
- Numpy  : pip install numpy
